    #GBV Aspect
    
    Gender based violence has really become a great problem in South Africa. Most of the solutions
    more so the technological aspects developed to tackle this challenges are not aimed at really
    solving the core of the problem but mostly targeting those who might be affected. These includes
    applications developed for panick situations and reporting when such cases occur.
    
    Because GBV is mainly experienced in townships, areas where most people are either not learned 
    or learned but dropped out of school along the way because of various reasons. Most of these people
    not only don't have knowledge on the effects of GBV but also are unaware of what to do in such cases.
    For those who are learned enough know that for example they can report this to the cops but most don't.
    
    Hadithi application will be geared towards solving these problem by focusing on the impact of story telling.
    Stories told by professionals and survivors of GBV. We hope that by the members of the community listening to
    these stories they will begin to learn on the effects of GBV, how to prevent this and on how to report on this 
    cases.
    
    Now the question that comes to mind, how will motivate these people to watch the stories told in our application.
    We will have an incentive system, whereby for each video watched -> the user is asked to give feedback on what they
    learned from the video. These feedback will be either text or audio for those who can't type. If the feedback given 
    relates to the information in the video points are awarded and if not, no point is awarded. These is to make sure 
    that actually people do listen to these videos and they don't just play them
    
    These points can be redeemed for cash that the persons can use for purchase of food an other things
    
    #Education Aspect
    The application will also have a section focused on the educational aspect. In this the story telling videos 
    uploaded in this application will be geared towards inspiring high school students. These will be made so 
    by listening to the alumni that came before them (mainly university students) tell them that they can. Tell there
    stories of success and failures and how they actualy went about it.
    
    I really believe story telling can change lives. I wanna use to imact both the educational sector and help promote 
    awareness of GBV
